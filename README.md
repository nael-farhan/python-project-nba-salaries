# python-project-nba-salaries
Project for the 2nd year Python course at ENSAE

With this project, we conduct an analysis on NBA players salaries. We try to predict salaries by using different methods (regressions and Machine Learning), and then based on our results tell if a team has underpaid or overpaid their players compared to the other teams.

What's interesting with the NBA is that all teams have a cap space, which basically means that the sum of all the players salaries has a cap which is the same for everyone, therefore no teams can give a huge amount to a few players without having to pay less for other players. In soccer, it's much more different because richer teams have way higher salary mass than poorer teams.
